                                <p>&#34;Hyper-Reality presents a provocative and kaleidoscopic new vision of the future, where physical and virtual realities have merged, and the city is saturated in media.&#34;</p>

                            <p>Watching Keiichi Matsuda&rsquo;s video &ldquo;HYPER-REALITY&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJg02ivYzSs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJg02ivYzSs</a>) was as fascinating as it was utterly chilling. The top-notch editing definitively helped to sell me on the likelihood of a future with technology so ubiquitous that we would constantly see the world through Mixed Reality (and all the dangers that comes with it). The abuses really are numerous in this video, but let&rsquo;s try to find some other scenarios where such technology could create <em>massive</em> problems.</p>
<h3 id="when-data-make-our-choices-for-us">When data make our choices for us</h3>
<p>First, one very striking detail in the video I would like to elaborate upon is how one product (here, a yogurt) changes its appearance and adapts its labeling based on the person that sees it. <em>That</em>&rsquo;s marketing pushed to the next level. Yet it is also kind of what we are experiencing now, on the web or the social medias, where it&rsquo;s sometimes frightening how accurate the ads I&rsquo;m getting are. Now let&rsquo;s imagine that applied to MR and for everything in our daily lives. The huge of amount of data about ourselves recorded at each instant could be used to modify and manipulate all that we see to accurately influence us based on our preferences, and that doesn&rsquo;t only apply to yogurts or ads. Imagine walking into a museum, a shopping mall or even a whole city where your path is entirely laid out for you: we saw how we could trick what you see (or rather what you&rsquo;re not seeing) when you focus on something (or the &lsquo;Monkey Business&rsquo; illusion) to make you walk in circle in VR. It is not unreasonable to think something of the sort could be replicated in MR to guide you.</p>
<p>Take this example below of the supermarket (because that&rsquo;s the easiest thing to illustrate):</p>
<p><img src="https://arthurtl.github.io/thelambdadiary/images/MRsupermarket2.png" alt="Mixed-Reality Supermarket" title="Mixed-Reality Supermarket">
What I and another person see wouldn&rsquo;t be the same because it would be tailored to match what we want - or some companies or other entities may think we want -. But here this kind of advertising would mix into our perception of reality to the point where it is no longer possible to deviate from this path laid for us. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be bright lights or false obstacles necessarily like I represented on this picture because that may be too twisted, but there sure are plenty of clever ways to pull this off. And wouldn&rsquo;t it be more comfortable, to have all the thinking done for us and only have to follow the big arrows ? Creepy.</p>
<h3 id="when-we-have-many-faces">When we have many faces</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been amazed by the credibility of today&rsquo;s deepfakes or computer generated faces. With appropriate technology, you could virtually make anyonye say anything. Now imagine a future where this faces could be displayed in real time on top of yours: it could be your own with a different emotion, different make-up, features or Snapchat filter, but it could also be a virtual avatar or even the actual face of someone else. While it sounds practical to be able to change its appearance at will, it also comes with all the identity dangers you can think of, especially (but not only) in the latter case. Of course all the dirty scams you find on the net would be even more dangerous in real life, but it would also make it easier to deceive someone about what you are really feeling. Again, it&rsquo;s just like with text messaging today, but seeing it applied to real face-to-face conversation makes it somewhat scarier.</p>
<p><img src="https://arthurtl.github.io/thelambdadiary/images/MRfaces.png" alt="Mixed-Reality Many-faces" title="Mixed-Reality Many-faces"></p>
<p>&ldquo;The face is the mirror of the soul&rdquo; they say. I&rsquo;d be curious to see how that would apply when we have a thousand of them.</p>
