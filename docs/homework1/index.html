                            <p>In his paper entitled &lsquo;The Ultimate Display&rsquo;, Ivan E. Sutherland described a future computer interface so advanced it could literally &ldquo;control the existence of matter&rdquo;. With this display, all that appears around us would not only look but also smell, taste and <em>feel</em> entirely real, the pioneer of extended reality explains. In fact, with appropriate programming, everything displayed would indeed be real insofar as it would take shape and could be interacted with as we would in the physical world - and with the same consequences -. More than a mere replica of the world, this ultimate display could also provide additional knowledge and visual representations of things as they are not bound by the laws of the one we actually live in. A real Alice&rsquo;s Wonderland, as he puts it.</p>
<p><img src="https://arthurtl.github.io/thelambdadiary/images/ultimatedisplay/spectrum.png" alt="Reality-Virtuality Spectrum" title="The Reality-Virtuality Spectrum"></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to put the massive <em>Matrix</em> vibes aside and try to fit this display into this Reality-Virtuality spectrum. It&rsquo;s obviously not so easy as it doesn&rsquo;t exactly fit all the definitions we have, which are themselves imperfect and still evolving. Is it <strong>reality</strong>?  Almost, as it can be experienced by all our senses without distinction with the physical world. A &ldquo;bullet&rdquo; here would be as real and deadly as a normal one. But as mentionned, it is also much <em>more</em> than reality and there is still the technological factor that separates it from the definition of a &ldquo;real environment&rdquo;. Calling it <strong>Augmented Reality</strong> or really anything else within the realm of <strong>Mixed Reality</strong> would also be an understatement, as it is implied that everything down to the matter itself would be controled by a computer, so the physical world and its rules would not have that much of a part to play here.</p>
<p>In fact, since everything is computer generated, it could be considered <strong>Virtual Reality</strong> with its current definitions: a fully rendered world hiding the reality, an accurate tracking of &ldquo;any muscles in our body&rdquo;, a real-time processing of each of our actions <em>and</em> a strong feeling a presence. Yet it may be that this definition only takes into account our current technologies because there remains some key differences between Sutherland&rsquo;s display and what we are using today, the main one being the absence of a tangible <em>barrier</em> between what is virtual and what is not. With the oculus, it is a screen that we can be removed from our eyes, and nothing from the virtual world really crosses it to take form in the physical one. A chair in this virtual environment cannot actually be sat on as, well, it isn&rsquo;t <em>real</em>. But with the ultimate display this frontier appears extremely blurred and definitions have to be re-evaluated. Nothing is displayed on top of reality and hiding it anymore, it seems as if a new one is created inside it and nothing can really distinguish them - they are both only matter after all -.</p>
<p>So where does it lie in our continuum ? I would have a hard time placing it on a linear scale with both ends beings what is &ldquo;fully real&rdquo; and what&rsquo;s &ldquo;fully virtual&rdquo;. It feels like both should meet in some way, as virtual reality became so advanced it bleeds into the real world. But that&rsquo;s not to say it <em>becomes</em> the real world because it also comes with its own rules that can go far beyond it. Maybe it is not exactly the junction between the extremities of the continuum, but I would say it is close to both. So let&rsquo;s make it more of a circle:</p>
<p><img src="https://arthurtl.github.io/thelambdadiary/images/udisplay.png" alt="Circle continuum" title="Circle Continuum"></p>
<p>That would be how I place it. Or maybe we should clarify some terms and no longer put the emphasis on what is &ldquo;real&rdquo; or not but rather on what has been technologicaly altered are not; calling one end &ldquo;Reality&rdquo; can indeed be a bit ambiguous. Should we rename it &ldquo;Our pure, unaltered and natural environment&rdquo;, it would be much easier to place the Ultimate display far in the other direction, maybe even further than what we know define as Virtual Reality. That way we don&rsquo;t have to rely on our senses to determine which is what, also because presence is somehting much harder to gauge. We may be living inside the Matrix already, after all.</p>
