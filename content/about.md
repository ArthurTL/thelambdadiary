## Setup
This website was created using the static page generator Hugo.

If you are able to see this image above, it means that I managed to not mess things up ! 
Learning how to generate a webpage using Hugo was straightforward enough, but choosing a theme that really suits me was much more tricky. This one is called *Massively* and I find its layout very pleasing. All the blog posts are made very apparent from the main page and, since I like making things a bit visual, I also love being able to customize the header pictures as well as the background. Oh, and about that...

## The Background Image

I composed it myself from bits of artworks, academic works and even some personal projects I've made this year. Here's a deeper look if you are interested:

**1)** A character and lighting study from of a shot of the short film *The Summer of Snakes* (Lara Panah-Izadi 2020)

**2 and 2bis)** Other studies from two shots of *Nantong Nights* (Emma Qian Xu and LÃ©opold Dewolf 2021) I did this summer

**3)** A GoT landscape painting, one of the first piece I've ever did in digital art.

**4)** A screenshot of a scene created with the graphic engine I've coded to learn more about the 3D rendering pipeline!

**5)** A terrain made in Unity using custom brushes we made as part of the INF633 AI and Graphics course.

**6)** The output of a (very) early version of my IG3DA project "Automatic Single-View Character Model Reconstruction"

**7)** The little bubble-shooter game I created with a classmate for the HCI909 course about interactive systems

**8)** My version of the infamous blender donut so useful to discover the software :).
